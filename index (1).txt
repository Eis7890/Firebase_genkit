Notes 
Instructions: Please logon with Config Tool to change the federation configuration to point to the site you need to federate.
In Config Tool, go to "System" then "Roles" and you should see a federation role that is down (red). Click on that federation role and go to the "properties" tab and change Directory, username and password from the site you need to federate. Once the role is up and synchronized, you could load the Security Desk application and be able to see federated cameras.


Let me know if you need more help.
